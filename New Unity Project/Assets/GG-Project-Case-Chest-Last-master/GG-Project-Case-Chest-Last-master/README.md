# GG Case Project - Chest Moment

An Unity project to demonstrate how to create well designed animations in Unity.


## Getting started

In this project, we asked you to create an giftbox opening animation that provides nice feeling at the user side.
An example concept video can be found in the project folder. We also added 3D model for rotating card, two PNGs for rotating card texture and two 2D PNGs for chest. 


## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create another local repository
3. Create a project in Unity by using that repository.
4. Make your changes.
5. Share with "gulliversgames" on GitHub.


## Important Notice

What we expect is, to focus on chest opening animation at the beginning of the video and legendary card animation starting at 00.19.

If you need any help, plugins or have questions, please do not hesitate to ask.

## Good Luck!
